## Real time Weather Data Pipeline using Airflow
I built an ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow to extract real-time weather data for Boston from the Open Meteo API, transform it, and load it into PostgreSQL. Using the Astronomer CLI, I initialized and deployed the project locally with Docker containers for streamlined workflow management. This setup enabled efficient, reliable data extraction and storage.
